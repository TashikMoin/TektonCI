Affinity Assistant in Tekton is like a smart supervisor that helps you assign tasks to the right 
workers (nodes in the Kubernetes cluster). It ensures that tasks are given to the most suitable workers 
based on their capabilities and preferences.

For example, if a certain task requires a lot of memory, the Affinity Assistant will assign it to a 
worker (node) with plenty of memory available. Or if two tasks need to work together closely, it will 
put them on the same worker (node) to avoid communication delays.

In short, Affinity Assistant in Tekton helps optimize the workload distribution, making sure tasks are 
assigned to the best workers (nodes) to get the job done faster and more efficiently.


Note: Affinity Assistant use Inter-pod affinity and anti-affinity that require substantial amount of 
processing which can slow down scheduling in large clusters significantly. We do not recommend using 
them in clusters larger than several hundred nodes
