# A event listener service to listen for some event. Using this CRD, we also tell what actions to do by telling the triggertemplate name
# so that the triggertemplate can generate a tekton CRD and execute it using some data passed to it using triggerbinding. 

# In this CRD, we are also telling the triggerbinding name so that when a event is triggered, the event data will be sent to this "xyz.." 
# triggerbinding and the triggerbinding then sends event data to triggertemplate to generate a tekton CRD and execute it.

# This CRD creates a kubernetes ClusterIP service behind the scene with "el" prefix. 

# Create a curl pod to trigger event using the following,
# kubectl run -it --rm --image=curlimages/curl curl-pod -- sh

# execute following command inside curl pod to trigger event,
# curl -v -H 'content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username": "Tekton"}' http://<service internal/cluster ip>:8080
# for e.g --> curl -v -H 'content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username": "Tekton"}' http://10.0.75.58:8080
